            <h3>Informatics: Software Development, Design and Ethics.</h3>
            <p>Basically applied CS with a focus on human interactivity. Don't worry,
              we're still taught the math like set theory, algorithms, big O, and
              datastructures.

          <li>
            <h3>Economics: The study of human choice.</h3>
            <p>Economics is the study of human choice. Given scarce resources people
              make tradeoffs and we use math to determine the effects of these choices
              from the individual level to the scale of nations. My leanings are
              orthodox, of the New Keynesian flavor.</p>

            design and lighting on massive architectural models for use on low end
            systems. Developed and documented methods for scripting, modeling, testing,
            optimizing performance and generating gameplay. Optimized large architectural
            models to run in stereoscopic 3D with head tracking on mobile devices.
